<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<p>
By names i am Wafiq Mohamed a student at Moringa school who has just finished high school and is passionate about things to do with the tech world including software engineering .
Studied primary school(Jema Faith primary school) in a small school in Nairobi and then joined high school in Mombasa Sheikh Khalifa Secondary School where my dreams of software engineering had popped in my mind.
I would like to do programming so as to get the knowledge to drive myself in the field of technology as it is wide and it requires lots of skills and passion .My love for software engineering just came up as one of my favourite things that i was interested to do even though i also love other things like video editing i believe that when i pursue programming i will be far ahead and able to know alot and contribute to ever-evolving landscape of technology. It's an exciting journey filled with opportunities for growth, creativity, and making a meaningful impact
